We invited Zagovor and Other Half to represent the European and US contingents that make up the festival, and with the support and exciting new hop varieties of festival sponsor Yakima Chief, we put together this DDH IPA packed with tropical and orchard stone fruit aromas alongside twists of lime and lemon and an underlying layer of piney dankness from a hop bill including Cryo Pop\u2122, Talus\u2122 and the still experimental HBC 586 variety.",
